Feeds on worms, crustaceans and insects (Ref. 7020). Reproduces in captivity (Ref. 26543). Both parents guard the eggs and larvae (Ref. 7020). Has been used to control mosquito larvae (Ref. 40602). Aquarium keeping: in pairs; minimum aquarium size 100 cm (Ref. 51539).\nLife cycle and mating behavior Maturity | Reproduction | Spawning | Eggs | Fecundity | Larvae\nIn captivity, both male and female clean a rock which will be the spawning area. Eggs are laid on the rock by the female and fertilized by the male. Both male and female guard the eggs, which hatch in 2 to 5 days, and continue to look after the fry for some weeks (Ref. 7020). In cases of danger, the male protects its young by placing them inside its mouth (Ref. 26543).<\/h1>"},{"p1":"<p1>No category specified<\/p1>","header":"<header align=\"center\">Krab<\/header>","h1":"<h1 align=\"center\">nwowywywwyw<\/h1>"},{"p1":"<p1>akwarniane<\/p1>","header":"<header align=\"center\">Neon<\/header>","h1":"<h1 align=\"center\">Zyje<\/h1>"}]
